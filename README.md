# Bayesian-Top-Down-Population Disaggregation
This repository houses a collection of scripts designed for top-down population disaggregation using the **randomForest R package** and the **bartMachine R package **. It's aimed at disaggregating population count from a higher administrative level to small area levels.

## Scripts
There are four main scripts included in this repository:

 1. BART_Simulation_Workflow.R: This script implements a simulation study using Bayesian random forest disaggregation. It explores the capabilities of the Bayesian approach in population disaggregation.
 2. RF_Simulation_Workflow.R: This script conducts a simulation study using the randomForest R package. The results from this simulation study are compared to the Bayesian random forest approach to assess the predictive performance of both models.
 3. BART_Workflow.R: This workflow applies the Bayesian approach to disaggregate the 2021 census data of Ghana. It demonstrates the practical application of Bayesian random forest in population disaggregation.
 4. Random_Forest_Workflow.R: This workflow employs the randomForest package to disaggregate the 2021 census data of Ghana. It showcases the application of the random forest modelling approach in the same context.
## Usage
To get started with the scripts and workflows in this repository:
1.	Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.	Install the necessary R packages, including randomForest and bartMachine, if you haven't already.
3.	Run the desired script or workflow to explore top-down population disaggregation using the specified modelling approach.
## Contribution
Contributions and enhancements to this repository are welcome. Feel free to submit issues, fork the repository, or create pull requests to collaborate and improve the scripts and workflows.
